By setting clear expectations, leaders provide a framework for measuring and evaluating team performance effectively.

## Identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are crucial for assessing team performance. We explore strategies for leaders to identify relevant KPIs that align with team goals and objectives. By selecting meaningful and quantifiable indicators, leaders can track progress, measure success, and identify areas requiring improvement.
